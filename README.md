## Features
- Real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka.
- Data processing and analysis using Apache Spark.
- Dockerized deployment for easy setup and scaling.
- Python-based application with PostgreSQL integration.

## Technologies Used
- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data streaming.
- **Apache Spark**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Docker**: For containerization.
- **PostgreSQL**: As the database.
- **Python**: The main programming language used.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sallahda/realtime-election-data-project.git
    cd realtime-election-data-project
    ```

2. Set up the environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
